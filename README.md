# beads.el - Emacs Client for Beads Issue Tracker

[![Codeberg Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codeberg-Repository-2185D0?logo=codeberg&logoColor=white)](https://codeberg.org/ctietze/beads.el)

## Overview

beads.el provides an Emacs interface to the [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracking system.
Beads is a lightweight, Git-backed issue tracker that stores data locally in
`.beads/` alongside your code. It works well with AI coding assistants but
doesn't require them—you can use it entirely from Emacs or the command line.

## Installation

### From MELPA (Recommended)

Once available on MELPA:

```elisp
(use-package beads
  :ensure t)
```

Or with `package.el`:

```elisp
(package-install 'beads)
```

### From Git (Emacs 30+)

With the built-in `:vc` keyword:

```elisp
(use-package beads
  :vc (:url "https://codeberg.org/ctietze/beads.el" :lisp-dir "lisp" :rev :newest))
```

### Manual Installation

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/beads.el/lisp")
(require 'beads)
```

### With straight.el

## Requirements

- Emacs 28.1+
- [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) CLI: `bd` 0.49.1+ (recommended) or `br` (beads_rust)
- `hierarchy` package (for dependency tree view)
- `transient` package (for menus)
- `vui` package (for declarative UI components)
- `markdown-mode` (optional, for editing long text fields)

### CLI Backends

beads.el supports two CLI backends:

- **`bd`** (default) — Full-featured. Supports daemon mode for fast
  communication via socket, with CLI fallback. Start the daemon with `bd daemon`.
- **`br`** (beads_rust) — CLI-only, no daemon support. Reduced operation set
  (no activity feed, comments, or reopen). Useful if you only have `br` installed.

Auto-detection tries `bd` first, then `br`. Override per-project via
`.dir-locals.el`:

```elisp
((nil . ((beads-cli-program . "br"))))
```

Or globally:

```elisp
(setq beads-cli-program "br")
```

## Development

This project uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) itself for issue tracking.
You can check out the repository and view the project's issues:

```bash
# Start the daemon
bd daemon

# Launch Emacs with beads.el loaded
make interactive
```

Then run `M-x beads-list` to see the beads.el development issues.
