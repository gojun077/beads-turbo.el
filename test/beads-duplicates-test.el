;;; beads-duplicates-test.el --- Tests for beads-duplicates.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the Beads duplicate detection view.
;;
;; Test categories:
;; 1. Mode definition tests - test beads-duplicates-mode is defined correctly
;; 2. Keybinding tests - test RET, m, M, g, q bindings
;; 3. Command availability tests - test commands are defined
;; 4. Render tests - test display formatting

;;; Code:
