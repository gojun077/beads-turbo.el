;;; beads-detail-test.el --- Tests for beads-detail.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the Beads issue detail mode.
;;
;; Test categories:
;; 1. Face definition tests - test all faces are defined with expected properties
;; 2. Render tests - test beads-detail--render inserts expected sections (mocked)
;; 3. Mode tests - test mode setup, keybindings, and read-only behavior
;; 4. Integration tests - test with actual daemon (tagged :integration)
;;
;; Note on test isolation:
;; Integration tests connect to the actual beads daemon in this repo.
;; Tests are read-only and do not modify data.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'beads-detail)
(require 'beads-test-helpers)
