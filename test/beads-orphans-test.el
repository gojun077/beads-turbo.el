;;; beads-orphans-test.el --- Tests for beads-orphans.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the Beads orphans view.
;;
;; Test categories:
;; 1. Mode definition tests - test beads-orphans-mode is defined correctly
;; 2. Keybinding tests - test RET, c, g, q bindings
;; 3. Command availability tests - test commands are defined

;;; Code:
