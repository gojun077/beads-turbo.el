;;; beads-stale-test.el --- Tests for beads-stale.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the Beads stale issues view.
;;
;; Test categories:
;; 1. Mode definition tests - test beads-stale-mode is defined correctly
;; 2. Keybinding tests - test RET, c, g, d, f, q bindings
;; 3. Command availability tests - test commands are defined
;; 4. Days calculation tests - test beads-stale--days-ago
