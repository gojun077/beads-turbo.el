;;; beads-activity-test.el --- Tests for beads-activity.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the Beads activity feed.
;;
;; IMPORTANT: As of bd 1.0.x, the `bd activity` subcommand does NOT exist
;; (see issue bdel-a6p).  These tests validate the Emacs Lisp rendering layer
;; (mode, keybindings, glyphs, faces, error handling) and do NOT call the CLI.
;; They remain useful should bd reintroduce an activity/event-feed command.
;; If that never happens, the entire beads-activity.el module and these tests
;; should be removed or reimplemented on top of a future bd event-feed command.
;;
;; Test categories:
;; 1. Mode definition tests - test beads-activity-mode is defined correctly
;; 2. Keybinding tests - test RET, f, F, g, l, q bindings
;; 3. Command availability tests - test commands are defined
;; 4. Glyph and face tests - test event visualization
